title: About
---

I am a data scientist living in St. Louis, MO, and working as a technical lead for [DataKind](https://wwww.datakind.org). I am interested developing data science and machine learning tools in the public and non-profit sector and making data science accessible to all. When not in front of a monitor, I am outside running, watching a Coen Brothers movie, or listening to the latest Freakonomics podcast.
