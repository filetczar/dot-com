I am a data scientist living in St. Louis, MO, and working as a technical lead for [DataKind](https://wwww.datakind.org). I am interested developing data science and machine learning tools, and making data science accessible to all. When not in front of a monitor, I am outside running, watching a Coen Brothers' movie, or listening to the latest Freakonomics podcast.

Feel free to connect on [twitter](https://twitter.com/filetczar) or an email at azar dot phil at gmail dot com. Open to chatting about data science topics or freelancing for any of the following ooportunities:

* Reproducible Statistical Analysis and Measurement
* Training, Evaluating and Deploying ML at Scale 
* Developing Data Science Applications and Dashboards
